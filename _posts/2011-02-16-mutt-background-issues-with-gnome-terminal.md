title: 'Mutt transparent background issues with gnome terminal'
description: Here is how to solve it, and have a transparent background in Mutt.

I recently decided that I would give Mutt a go, and can already see its benefits after a short trial.
Only thing was that it looked so ugly! 50% grey solid background and white text?? Turns out it has issues with transparency in gnome terminal.

Here is how to solve it, and have a transparent background in Mutt.

Simply put this line in your ~/.bashrc
export COLORFGBG=&quot;default;default&quot;

Then refer to the transparent background as &quot;default&quot; in your ~/.muttrc, such as the example below
color normal greenÂ 		default
