title: 'saving your vimperator theme'

---

Once you have downloaded your preferred theme, move it to ~/.vimperator/colors
put the following line in your ~/.vimperatorrc file.Â  If you do not have one, create it.

<span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>colorscheme obsidian</strong></span> <em>//or whatever your theme is called</em>

<em></em>If you already have firefox open, source the file to load the new color scheme by typing :so ~/.vimperatorrc
