title: 'saving your pentadactyl theme'

---

Once you have downloaded your preferred theme, move it to ~/.pentadactyl/colors
put the following line in your ~/.pentadactylrc file.Â  If you do not have one, create it.

colorscheme obsidian <em> //or whatever your theme is called</em>

If you already have firefox open, source the file to load the new color scheme by typing :so ~/.pentadactylrc
